This game is similar to frogger, only instead of being a cute little frog trying to get 
across the street, you're a Georgia Tech student trying desperately to get to class without
becoming roadkill for the crazy people who drive around this campus.

To Play:

Begin at the start screen and read the instructions. Press Enter to start, and navigate your person (the rectangle in the bottom green area of the screen) across the traffic to reach the other side. Right Arrow takes you to the right, left to the left, up moves you upward, and down moves you downward. 

You have 5 tries to get to the other side before you lose!

Good luck!
